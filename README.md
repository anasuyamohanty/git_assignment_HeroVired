# Git and GitHub Assignment
This assignment has 2 python programs
 - CalculatorPlus python program
 - GeometryCalculator python program
 
Following document discusses about the two python programs in detailed with **screenshots**

## Program 1. CalculatorPlus Application

A simple Python calculator app that provides basic arithmetic operations and square root calculation.

### Features
- Addition: `add(a, b)`
- Subtraction: `subtract(a, b)`
- Multiplication: `multiply(a, b)`
- Division with safe handling of division-by-zero: `divide(a, b)`
- Square root calculation with input check: `square_root(x)`

### Repository Structure

h. After completing the feature implementation and ensuring that the application works correctly, create a pull request targeting the main branch. 
Test Scenario - 1 : Normal execution

i & j. Request a code review from a team member and make any necessary improvements based on the review feedback. 
Once the code reviewer approves your pull request, merge the "feature/sqrt" branch into the ‘dev’ branch.
